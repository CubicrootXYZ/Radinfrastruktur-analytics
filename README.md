# Radinfrastruktur-analytics

The code used for analytics about german infrastructure. In some cases the code will not be the most efficient one, it is just some quick and dirty statistics and plotting.

`run.py` contains the code for extracting the data from OSM and plot the network graphs. 

`data_vis.py`visualizes the data generated. 

`data` contains a .csv file with all collected measurements.
